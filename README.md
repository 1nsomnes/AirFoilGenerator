# AirFoilGenerator
 
As part of my engineering class at ASU I was challenged to design a wind turbine blade that would generate energy as efficiently as possible. Knowing little about designing an airfoils I used NACA [Airfoil Generator](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit) to get basic data points for a 2D spline. Using python I computationally create a script that will generate the splines from those datapoints in AutoCAD. From there I added various fun values to create a custom 3D airfoil. 

# Getting Started 
TBD 

# Features
- AutoCAD Spline Generation
- Specify Height
- Rotating Splines as moved up 

# Coming Soon...
- GUI
- User defined smoothing functions for rotation, width, depth, and height
