# AirFoilGenerator
 
As part of my engineering class at I was challenged to design a wind turbine blade that would generate energy as efficiently as possible. Knowing little about designing an airfoils I used NACA [Airfoil Generator](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit) to get basic data points for a 2D spline. Using python I computationally create a script that will generate the splines from those datapoints in AutoCAD. From there I added various fun values to create a custom 3D airfoil. 

Here are two different sized blades that I printed:

For detailed information on how the script was written and the ideas behind it please visit [the post on my blog](https://blog.cedricclaessens.com/the-art-of-designing-airfoils-with-the-naca-generator-and-autocad/)!
